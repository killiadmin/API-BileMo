# API_BileMo

BileMo is a company offering a whole selection of high-end mobile phones. You are in charge of the development of the
mobile phone showcase of the BileMo company. BileMo's business model is not to sell its products directly on the
website, but to provide all platforms that wish access to the catalog via an API (Application Programming Interface).

applications from other web platforms can perform operations.
